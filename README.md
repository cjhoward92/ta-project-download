# A UofA coding bootcamp github project helper

Requires node v >= 8.2.1.
Requires `git` v > 2.0.0 is installed and on your PATH.

### Setup

Make sure you have `yarn` installed globally (`npm install -g yarn`).
Run `yarn` in the project directory.

### Running

To run, use `yarn start <PATH>`.
If the path does not exist it will shit.

### Stuff we need

See `repos.js` and `users.js`. We need a list of the homework repo names and the github usernames
for each student...

You will notice a file called `server.js` that is unused. One day we may have a server show some web ui stuff. Today is not that day.

Also, this may not work on windows...

### DON'T BE A DICK AND PR CODE WITH LINTER ERRORS!!!
